            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is amongst the sayings of the Wise Man, <hi>A Word fitly spoken is like Apples of Gold in Pictures of Silver,</hi> Prov. 25. 11. A Word aptly circumstanced in respect of time, and other concurrences is of singular use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, weight and excellency: Did the Discourse following not sufficiently commend it self, or needed there any further Testimony to be added thereto; we might with confidence affirm, that it was indeed a <hi>Word fitly spoken, well Timed,</hi> and otherwise also <hi>Circumstanced</hi> as to them to whom it was delivered: and surely it is no other to such to whose perusal it is now presented.</p>
            <p>The Condition of Gods Wilderness-People (with other considerations also attending the same) bear full witness to it therein; when <hi>the Glory is depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> (may we not say in some, <hi>Oh that it were not in great measure departed)</hi> and the <hi>Defence also with it;</hi> what more seasonable or fitly-suited then such a Word, the design whereof is to awaken and advise to a Faithful Endeavour for the Recovery and Continuance of both; How far or by what gradual Removes the departure is made already, with reference to the Lords People here in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or any Societies in particular, is not so easie nor all things Considered so meet for us to determine; that there is indeed a diminution or abatement of the <hi>Glory in the midst of us</hi> (an awful presage of its yet further and at last final withdrawing, if not timely prevented by an intervening Repentance, Faith and effectual Reformation, thereby stirring up our selves to take hold of God.) that we are in danger also of being deprived of <hi>the Wall of fire about us</hi> (threatning Aspects of Providence of late appearing towards us therein) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well be denied by them that have been studious to keep the eye upon things past and present. Time was that <hi>Israel was holiness to the Lord,</hi> then all that devoured him did offend, <hi>evil came upon them,</hi> as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 3. But is it so at this day in respect of degrees? alas how low are we fallen? though we doubt not but the Lord hath his number, and that very considerable, whose hearts he keeps up in a holy warmth and forwardness of love <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o him, his will and wayes, yet how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have forsaken first love; (may we say the love of <hi>N. Englands Espousals)</hi> upon the decayes whereof, or neglect to recover it, a removal of the <hi>Candlestick</hi> is expresly threatned, even where there are many things commendable, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 2-5 that the Lord hath indeed been the Glory and Salvation of his people, and therein greatly manifested his mercy towards us amidst many provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is alwayes to be acknowledged with great thankfulness; that the same
<pb facs="tcp:47460:3"/> Lord is our alone hope in both respects for the future, it concerns us deeply, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more deeply to Remember. Alas what are we if the Lord leave us? if the glory depart from us what shall we be? but a dishonour to his Name, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to Religion, a Shame to our selves, and Grief to others, a very heap of Sins, and Chaos of Confusion; if the <hi>Wall of Fire</hi> forsake us, what shall we be, but a prey to them that are ready to devour? how soon and easily will our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries have occasion and spirit to say insultingly enough, <hi>they are bread for us?</hi> how resistless an inroad will all manner of Evil and Enemies make upon us?</p>
            <p>Observations of what hath been, and is, with intimations also about what may, or is like to be, according to Scripture discovery and the Lords wonted way of dealing with a professing priviledged People; may not too easily be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lookt. However the great work still remains, (which without peculiar help from above will certainly fail in its accomplishment) <hi>viz. that we believe in earnest, and demean our selves as believing, that our All is in the hand of God;</hi> In respect of Glory, and Defence, <hi>we stand and fall therein as his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure is to deal with us;</hi> One thing only we may further remark, <hi>that our great Concernment is so to carry in several Capacities and Performance of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties therein, that the Lord may be and continue to be</hi> the Glory in the midst of us, <hi>so shall we without failure experience</hi> the fulfilling of his Word, <hi>that a</hi> Wall of fire shall not be wanting: <hi>That it may so be, is the purpose and Aim of the</hi> ensuing Sermon, <hi>wherein the</hi> Learned Author, <hi>a</hi> Faithful Servant in his Masters Work according to the Wisdome given him, <hi>Warns, Counsels and Excites,</hi> with reference to what may further the attainment of such an end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That this also amongst other the Labours of the Lords Worthies for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, and of late may be made successful by a Blessing from Heaven; to awaken the secure, and quicken the backward, to</hi> Rouse sinners, <hi>and</hi> Recover Saints to <hi>a</hi> right sense of their several Duties in this dark and threatning day; <hi>That the work of our God may appear unto his Servants, and his Glory to their Children, that his</hi> Enlightning, Converting, Sanctifying, <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with also</hi> Protecting, Saving Presence <hi>may be with us, that thc Beauty of</hi> Truth, Peace <hi>and</hi> Holiness, an encreasing shine of zeal for God, <hi>the</hi> Purity of his wayes, <hi>and</hi> Fellowship with him therein, <hi>may yet be found amongst us; and that upon all the</hi> Glory may still and alwayes be a Defence;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Is the Hearts Desire and Prayer of us, who are thine in him that is the Saviour of all men, especially of them that Believe.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the foregoing part of this Chapter we have the Prophets Vision specified, and the sense and meaning of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First.</hi> The Vision of a Man with a Measuring Line in his hand, to measure <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in the breadth thereof, and in the length thereof, in the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>second</hi> Verses.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> the sense of this Vision Explained and Confirmed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Explained,</hi> That <hi>Jerusalem</hi> should be Re-inhabited and Repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, in the <hi>third</hi> and <hi>fourth</hi> Verses.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This confirmed with a promise of the Lords presence with them, in this <hi>fifth</hi> Verse: In which we have; (1) A promise of the Lords pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting presence, and that likened to a <hi>Wall of fire round about; For</hi> I saith the Lord, <hi>will be to her a Wall of fire round about.</hi> (2.) a promise of the Lords glorious presence in the midst of his people, for saith the Lord, <hi>I will be the Glory in the midst of her.</hi> (3.) Let us consider the Copulation, yea, the Connexion of these two, when the Lord was the Glory in the midst of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> then he would be <hi>a Wall of fire round about them,</hi> and his being a <hi>Wall of fire round about them,</hi> was in order to his being <hi>the Glory in the midst of them,</hi> for so it is expounded in <hi>Isai.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>Ʋpon all the Glory shall be the defence:</hi> Hence the Doctrine is this;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct. When the Lord is the Glory in the midst of a People then he will be a Wall of Fire round about them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lords protecting presence as a <hi>Wall of fire round about his People,</hi> and his Glorious Presence <hi>in the midst of them</hi> are concomitants, the one doth inseparably accompany the other. For the Proof and Explication let us consider:</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:47460:4"/>
            <p> 1. When Gods protecting presence is like <hi>a Wall of fire round about a People.</hi> 2. When the Lord is <hi>the glory in the midst of a People.</hi> 3. The Reason of the Relation and Connexion of these.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Gods protecting presence, <hi>as a Wall of fire,</hi> is when the Lord doth in an evident manner, and terrible manner protect them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In an evident manner; making his Protection as manifest to his People as if they see a <hi>Wall of fire round about them,</hi> Isai. 26. 1. <hi>In that day shall the Song be sung in the Land of Judah, we have a strong City, the Lord will appoint his Salvation for Walls and Bulwarks:</hi> Then is the Wall too high for the Enemy to Scale or climb over, then it is too deep to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermined, and then the Wall is too high to be broken down or battered; and the Lords Salvation as a Wall of Defence in an evident manner, is, when the Lord doth defend his People, either only by his own hand, or in an extraordinary manner, blessing small and weak means for their defence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Sometimes the Lord doth defend meerly and only by his own hand; and that is either by taking away the desire of the Enemy, that the Enemy shall not desire to do his People any harm as the Lord Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to his People of old, when they went up to appear before the Lord thrice in the year, <hi>at that time no man shall desire their Land,</hi> Exod 34. 24 they should at that time be so safe from invasion; or if the Enemy shall desire and attempt to do his People harm: yet sometimes the Lord by his immediate hand stirreth up the spirit of some <hi>Cyrus</hi> to be their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectour, as the People, of whom the Text doth speak, did finde it upon experience, <hi>Ezra</hi> 1. 1. or if the Lord shall permit the Serpent to cast out of his mouth Waters <hi>like a flood after the Woman fled into the wilderness:</hi> yet the Lord who ruleth in Heaven above, and on the Earth, will some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times make use of the Earth to help the Woman, <hi>and the Earth shall open her mouth and swallow up the floods the Dragon had cast out of his mouth,</hi> Rev. 12 15, 16. and thus he doth defend his People only by his own hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Or by his blessing of weak and small means for their defence and that is, either when his People are in a fearful and affrighted posture, as it was with the King of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and his People when they heard of the confederacie of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Ephraim</hi> against them, the heart of the King of <hi>Iudah</hi> and his People were moved as the Trees in the Wood are moved with the wind, <hi>Isai.</hi> 7. 2. and yet the Lord made it manifest, that they were but as the two tails of smoaking fire brands, <hi>soon extinguished,</hi> ver. 4. or when his People are in a divided state, that they cannot so unite in the use of means for their own safety as otherwise they might, as it was in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47460:4"/>
               <hi>Deborah</hi>'s time, for the divisions of <hi>Reuben</hi> were great thoughts of heart, and again for the divisions of <hi>Reuben</hi> were great thoughts of heart, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 5. 15. and yet the Lord gave them a Song of Triumph, and the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was, O <hi>God let thine Enemies perish, and those who love thee be as the Sun when it goeth forth in its might, and so the Land had rest,</hi> Judg. 5. ult. and in what a feeble state was <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in <hi>Zerubbabel</hi>'s time, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themselves by any outward means; what a day of small things, and yet the Lord said, <hi>not by might nor by power but by the Spirit of the Lord, and what art thou great mountain before Zerubbabel,</hi> Zech. 4. 5, 6. and thus the Lord defends in an extraordinary manner, by blessing weak means.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A defending in a terrible manner; we read in <hi>Exo.</hi> 14. 24. that the Lord in the <hi>Morning watch,</hi> right early and timely looked forth upon the Host of <hi>Egyptians</hi> and troubled them: it was a dreadful dismaying and confounding look, <hi>and he looked through the Pillar of fire,</hi> called a Pillar, noting strength and stability; but it stood as a Wall of defence between the <hi>Israelites</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> their Enemies: and in our Text we read of a <hi>Wall of fire,</hi> it scopeth at the same, to shew us how effectually but in a terrible manner the Lord doth defend his People; and that is in such a manner as is terrible to the Enemy, and sometimes at the first appearance of it, is terrible to the Lords people themselves.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In such a manner as is terrible to the Enemy, sometimes the Lord by his own immediate hand doth dart into their minds such affrighting Fantasies, and dismaying apparitions as shall fill their Ears, Heads and Hearts with such confounding noises and reports, which shall make them like the <hi>Syrians</hi> of old, whom the Lord caused to hear the noise of the Chariots and Horse-men, as the noise of a great Host, and they rose up and fled away, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7. 6. we read of <hi>Zions</hi> Enemies in <hi>Psal.</hi> 48. 5, 6, 7, 8. they saw, they were troubled, and they hasted away, Fear took hold of them as <hi>of a woman in travel,</hi> there thou breakest the Ships of <hi>Tarshish,</hi> as we have heard so we have seen in the City of our God, he will Establish her, <hi>Selah:</hi> This is to defend his People in such a manner as is terrible to their Enemies.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And sometimes in such a manner, as at the first aspect and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance seemeth terrible to his people: the Lord will sometimes make use of a terrible means to be the carrier of the answer of the Prayers of his People, <hi>Psal.</hi> 65. 5. <hi>thou dost answer us by terrible things in thy righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness O God of our Salvation,</hi> and the Lord chooseth to relieve by terrible things, <hi>Isai.</hi> 4. 3. <hi>thou didst terrible things which we looked not for when thou
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47460:5"/> camest down, and the Mountains flowed down at thy presence, we did no more expect relief by such a means then to see Mountains to melt and become a plain;</hi> it is of our selves to destroy our selves, but it is the Lord alone can save us by destroying means, to make use of a Bear to preserve a Lamb is a strange and marvellous thing, but <hi>Persia</hi> was likened to a Bear, in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7 5. and <hi>Cyrus</hi> the King of <hi>Persia</hi> must become to be Protectour of the Lambs company, <hi>Ezra</hi> 1. 1, 2. this is to defend his People by a <hi>Wall of Fire</hi> in a terrible manner.</p>
            <p>Only let us distinguish of the degree of Protection:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Sometimes the Protection is total and full without any loss at all to Gods People, that whatever the Blasphemous threatnings of a <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shekah</hi> hath been in the day of Reproach and time of <hi>Zions</hi> trouble, yet the Lord putteth a Hook into the Nose, and a Bridle into the Lips of the Enemy, and would not suffer them so much as to come into the City, nor shoot an Arrow, nor come before them with a Shield, <hi>Isai.</hi> 37. 38. then the Protection is total and plenary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Sometimes the Lord only defends the Body of his People, the most considerable part of them, and then the loss they suffer shall be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued at a very considerable price; when <hi>Joshua</hi> had lost about thirty six men, and had sought out and removed the accursed thing, it then must cost the Enemy no less then <hi>twelve thousand</hi> lives, <hi>Josh.</hi> 7. 8-25. the Lord will make it manifest that <hi>precious in his sight is the death of his Saints, Psal.</hi> 116. 15. if a Godly man did foresee at what price the Lord of Hosts doth value his life, and how many lives it must cost the Enemy, if he doth suffer the loss of his own life in the cause of God, &amp; for his People, it would make him surely content <hi>Sampson</hi> like, to lay down his life even among the <hi>Philistims:</hi> thus you have heard how the Lords protecting presence is as <hi>a Wall of fire round about the Lords People,</hi> the conclusion of this, <hi>who is like to thee O Israel? a People saved of the Lord, the shield of thine help, the sword of thine excellency, thine Enemies shall be found Lyars to thee, and thou shalt tread upon their high places,</hi> Deut. 32. ult. and of this protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing presence, as a <hi>wall of fire</hi> the Lords People both in <hi>Old England</hi> and in <hi>New England</hi> have enjoyed their time of experience, in dayes of old and lately and in particular this Colony hath found it to be true: let your Enemies in this case be Judges; here are many of you in this great Congregation, now appearing this day before the Lord, who are his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, and are ready to say, as we have heard so we have seen in the City of our God, <hi>the Lord is known in Zions Pallaces to be a refuge,</hi> Psal. 48 2.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47460:5"/> he was thus known in dayes of old to the confusion of your Enemies, and in that day known to you for your abundant joy.</p>
            <p>But at present let us tarry no longer upon the proof of that which is so plain in the Word and Works of the Lord, in the several Generations of the Saints; and to our own experience in dayes of old, and to this very day: but let us proceed to enquire when will the Lord be a <hi>Wall of Fire round about a People?</hi> the answer to this is from the second part of the Doctrine, <hi>VVhen the Lord is the Glory in the midst of his People, then he will be a wall of fire round about them;</hi> and therefore let us enquire concerning this Glory, omitting the multiplicity of Interpretations of that Word, and coming as nextly and directly to the true Gospel sense of it (as I can) I take it may be thus described: This <hi>Glory</hi> is the Splendor and Shine of Divine Excellency; as God is a God of Mercy and Holiness, appearing in the Glass of his Word and Ordinances, whereby he transformeth a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into his likeness, and disposeth them practically to his praise and Glory.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Splendor and Shine of his Divine Excellency, it is the Glory of the <hi>Sun, Moon and Stars,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 41 their Splendor in the Light and Beams suitable to their Coelestial nature and excellency; we reade of the <hi>Glory of the Son of God, John</hi> 1. 14. <hi>VVe beheld his Glory as the Glory of the Son of God;</hi> that is, the Shine of his Divine Excellency suitable to, and becoming him as he is the Son of God: The <hi>Glory of God in the midst of a People,</hi> is the Splendor and Shine of his Divine Excellency in the light, Rayes and Beams thereof suitable, his excellent Being and well-becoming his Divine Perfection; for <hi>how great is his Goodness? how great is his Beauty?</hi> Zech. 9. ult. and upon this Splendor is the promised defence <hi>Psal.</hi> 80. 1. <hi>O thou that dwellest between the Cherubims, shine bright,</hi> and it followeth in the second verse <hi>then stir up thy strength and come and save us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Shine of Divine Excellency, as God is the God of Mercy and Holiness; for as God is the God of Nature and ruleth the Creatures, so there is a Shine of his Divine Excellency, in Framing and Ruling of the Creatures, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 1. <hi>The Heavens do declare thy Glory, and the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thy handy work;</hi> but the Glory of which our Text doth speak seemeth rather to be the Shine of his Divine Excellency more especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as he is the God of mercy and Holiness, of Grace and of Purity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> As he is the God of Mercy and Grace, intending especially the Splendor and Shine of his Mercy, as in the forementioned place, <hi>Psa.</hi> 80. 1 <hi>O thou that feedest Israel give ear, and leadest Joseph like a Flock, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47460:6"/> dwellest between the Cherubims shine bright: who dwellest between the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims, who were nigh to the Mercy Seat,</hi> Exod. 25. 21, 22. And the Mercy Seat was a Type of the Throne of Grace, where Christ our merciful High Priest is enthroned, and from whence for his Mercy sake he hath promised to meet with, and graciously to commune with his People in the times and cases of difflculty whatsoever: <hi>O thou that dwellest between the Cherubims shine bright;</hi> the shine of his Mercy from the Throne of Graces, and then it followeth, <hi>stir up thy strength and come and save us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As he is the God of Holiness; the shine of his Mercy in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pure and holy manner called <hi>the Beauties of Holiness,</hi> Psal. 110. 3. and the <hi>Cherubims</hi> which are called <hi>Seraphims</hi> in <hi>Isai.</hi> 6. 3. were crying in the Temple, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of Hosts:</hi> and when the Lord doth appear amongst a People to be Glorious in Holiness, then he will be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Praises, and do wonderful things for their safety, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 11. Jer. 2. 2, 3. <hi>I remember the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine Espousals when thou wentest after me into the VVilderness, Israel was Holiness unto the Lord, and they who destroyed him sbould then surely offend, and evil shall come upon them saitb the Lord,</hi> So that upon this Shine of Mercy and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness amongst a People is the defence promised.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Appearing in the Glass of the Word and Ordinances; there is a Glory appearing in the Glass of divine Providences, and is called <hi>a Glory,</hi> Exod. 16. 7, 10. but the Glory in the midst of a People seemeth to be rather a Glory appearing in the Glass of the Word and Ordinances; that which was typified by the Glory which came first into the Tabernacle of old when finished, <hi>Exod.</hi> 40. 34. the Glory which likewise came into the first Temple, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 10. the Glory which came into the second Temple of which our Text speaketh, and is so expounded in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43. 4. and applied to that very time in <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>For</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>the place of my Throne, and of the Soles of my feet, where I will dwell amongst the Children of Israel,</hi> and this Tabernacle Glory, and Temple Glory was a Type of the true Gospel Glory: for now as in a Glass (namely) in the Glass of Word and Ordinances we behold the Glory of the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>ult</hi> and a Type of the Glory of the <hi>new Jerusalem</hi> spoken of in <hi>Rev</hi> 21 and upon this Glory thus shining in the Glass of the Word and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is the promised defence, <hi>Isai.</hi> 4. 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Whereby the Lord transformeth a People into his likeness, and disposeth them particularly to his Praise and Glory; this is effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and indeed the Character of a People in the midst of whom he will
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47460:6"/> be the Glory, and round about whom he will be the Wall of fire, for they have not only the Glory set before them as in a Glass; so its before multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes in the Glass of Word and Ordinances: but they by beholding of this Glory are transformed from Glory to Glory by the Spirit of the Lord 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>vlt.</hi> and thus its a Glory amongst them by way of transformation, and therefore we say doth practically dispose them to his Praise and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that such a People have not only Glory set before them as a copy, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, and Example, as the Rule is the Idea or Example of <hi>Eupraxie</hi> or <hi>Well-acting,</hi> but its a Glory in the midst of them by way of imitation and practise, effectually and practically a Glory in the midst of them. And here let us take a brief view how this Glory did appear in the midst of this People of whom the Text doth speak, by way of transformation and imitation, practically and effectually respecting their Church and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil State, in Rulers and in People.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In General, Let us Consider then the hearts both of Rulers and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were set to seek the Lord their God with <hi>their faces Zionward weeping,</hi> they did go to joyn in a Covenant not to be forgotten, and that in a day of publick Humiliation; their Hearts subscribing with their Hands, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. ult. and they entred into a Curse and into an Oath, to walk in the Law of the Lord, <hi>Neh.</hi> 10. 29. <hi>Into a Curse and into an Oath,</hi> O Dreadful! but yet a very beautiful Solemnity they did put upon the staffe of beauty the Covenant of their God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. More particularly, then the People did lay to heart the evil of sin, and wept sore because of the Abominations committed, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. 1 <hi>and they trembled at the Commandment of the Lord,</hi> ver. 3. and then was that harmonious speech heard among them, so full of the Splendour of Grace and Godliness, some in the name of many others, saying to <hi>Ezra, Arise, this matter belongs to thee, only be of good courage and do it, and we are with thee,</hi> Ezra 10. 4.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And yet more especially, how did this Glory practically appear in the Rulers of the Common-wealth and of the Church, as was manifest in their purging Pollutions out of the Temple, <hi>Neh.</hi> 13. 5-8. in reforming biting Usury, taking (as it were) the prey out of the teeth, yea, breaking the Jaw-bone of the Oppressor, <hi>Neh.</hi> 5. 1-15 and then they did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially proceed without fear of any or favour to any whomsoever, as appears in that matter of removing strange Wives, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. severity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those who prophaned the Sabbath, <hi>Neh.</hi> 13.</p>
            <p>To conclude this, How did their Magistrates their, nursing Fathers, <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubbabel,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47460:7"/> Mordecai, Nehemiah</hi> and others shine with pious policy, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous righteousness, and holy courage, that <hi>Zions</hi> Judges were restored as at first, &amp; her Counsellers as at the beginning, as was promised &amp; prophecied concerning them, <hi>Isai.</hi> 1. 16, 17. &amp; the Glory of the Lord thus appeared by way of transformation and imitation, practically and effectually in the midst of this People, accordingly his protecting presence was as a <hi>wall of fire round about them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us now consider the Reasons of the Relation, and the connexion of these two; <hi>why the Lord will be a wall of fire round about a People when he is the Glory in the midst of them:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reas. 1. <hi>Because he is the Glory in the midst of them: he will not give his Glory to another,</hi> Isai 42. 8. you know what <hi>Joshua</hi> pleaded, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 7. 9. <hi>that the Enemy would come and cut off their name, and Lord what wilt thou do for thy great Name,</hi> it is as if he had said, were it only the cutting off our Name, and the throwing down and burying our Honour in the dust, we should be silent, it becometh us to put our mouths in the dust, and to keep silence, <hi>for unto us belongs shame and confusion,</hi> but Lord, its thy Great Name, and what wilt thou do for thy Great Name? was it ever known while the <hi>Lords Glory is in the midst of a People</hi> that he would suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to be laid waste, this cannot be with respect to his own Name and Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Thence follows an endeared respect the Lord hath to a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple while he is the <hi>Glory in the midst of them;</hi> for he loves his Glory, and therefore hath an endeared respect for those who are transformed into his likeness, he loves them as <hi>the apple of his eye,</hi> as in <hi>Zech.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>After the Glory</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>I am sent to the Nations who spoiled you, for he that toucheth you toucheth the Apple of mine eye saith the Lord:</hi> and we read in <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. <hi>ult.</hi> that the Church was compared to a Candlestick, and the Rulers in the Common-wealth and Church were likened to two Olive Trees, who were to stand on the right side and left side of the Candlestick, to supply it with golden Oile, that which is very precious, that the light of Grace and splendor of Godliness might appear in them; and while they thus stood with the Candlestick, they stood before the Lord of Hosts, <hi>the Lord of the whole Earth,</hi> as his anointed ones, <hi>and who should touch his Anointed to do them any harm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. The Conclusion of this is, if the Lord doth promise to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and defend us, it is upon condition that we be directed and ruled by him, if he be <hi>the wall of fire round about us;</hi> its upon condition that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47460:7"/> we do receive and set up himself <hi>as the Glory in the midst of us,</hi> the Pillar of Fire was to be for Direction as well as for Protection, <hi>Isai.</hi> 33. 22. <hi>the Lord is our Judge; the Lord is our Lawgiver, the Lord is our King and he will save us;</hi> while the Lord ruleth among us as our Judge, our Lawgiver and our King, so long he will save us, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23. 21, 22, 23. <hi>Balaam</hi> knew this to be verily true, to the confusion of all his Inchantments, for he said the shout of a King is in the midst of them; and it followeth, <hi>there is no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment against Jacob, nor Divination against Israel,</hi> and to this time it shall be said, <hi>what hath God wrought?</hi> not but that the Lord may for a time preserve a People in the midst of whom he is not the Glory, but if he be not the Glory among them, and hath no purpose to set up his Glory in the midst of them, it may be rather called a reserving them for an evil day to come then at present a preserving of them. Let us now proceed to the Use:</p>
            <p>Use 1. <hi>By way of Information:</hi> In the first place it may serve to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to us the way of the Lords dispensations and manner of his dealings with a Professing People, <hi>while he is the Glory in the midst of them,</hi> and maketh them to look forth as the morning, fair as the Moon, elear as the Sun, and terrible as <hi>an Army with Banners,</hi> Cant. 6. 10. but if the time be come for the coals of the fire of the Lords anger to be scattered among a People, first his Glory departs out of the Temple, and then out of the City, <hi>Ezek.</hi> chap. 10, <hi>&amp;</hi> 11. <hi>the Glory first departs out of the Church, and then out of Court and Common-wealth, and their Glory becometh like the setting Sun, the shadows of the Evening are stretched out upon them,</hi> the Enemy then saith, <hi>let us arise and go up by night and destroy her Palaces,</hi> Jer. 6. 5, 6. its now <hi>Zions</hi> night and our time, <hi>let us now go up and destroy her Palaces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>By way of Information,</hi> we may see what Glory the Lord is engaged to defend: its <hi>when he is the Glory in the midst of a People;</hi> Hence it followeth:</p>
            <p n="1">1. He is not engaged to defend carnal Pompe and worldly Glory, for he hath purposed to stain the pride of all such Glory, and to bring into contempt the honourable of the Earth, <hi>Isai.</hi> 23. 9. this the Lord is doing upon the Kingdomes of the World at this time.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Neither is the Lord engaged to defend the place where sometimes he hath been the Glory and hath put an honour upon that place, <hi>Ier.</hi> 9. 12. go to <hi>Shiloh</hi> and see what the Lord hath done, <hi>Shiloh</hi> was the first place where the Ark of the Lord was settled, after his People had possession of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and <hi>Shiloh</hi> was the first place where the Glory of God
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47460:8"/> was seen by the People in a settled manner, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 18. 1. but the time came when he forsook his Tabernacle in <hi>Shiloh,</hi> and the Tent which he had pitched amongst men, and delivered up his strength unto Captivity, and his Glory into the Enemies hand, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 61, 62. the Ark of the Lord, the means of divine strength, and the glass of Divine Glory was taken, thence that lamentation, <hi>the glory is departed from Israel, for the Ark of the Lord is taken,</hi> 1 Sam 4. ult..</p>
            <p n="3">3. Neither will the Lord be engaged to defend that People who hath enjoyed Visions of his Glory and of his greatness, if they be but meer Visions, and have wrought no gracious reformation, and no glorious transformation among them, we read of a People who had seen his Glory and his greatness, and after all the Visions they had of his Glory, yet his wrath was made known against them according to his Oath, against them in his anger that they should never <hi>enter into his rest, &amp; they perished in the way,</hi> and we read or a burning kindled under a Glory, and as a fire shall consume, <hi>Isai.</hi> 10. 16. this is verily true, not only concerning all carnal pompe and worldly Glory, but of all such persons who with a carnal eye acting under the power of carnal and inferiour Principles have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding Divine Glory in the Glass of Word and Ordinances.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ʋse</hi> 2. This Doctrine calleth for Self-examination; Let us Examine our selves, and commune with our hearts according to the former Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, we live in perilous dayes; are some Storms blown over? worse then those may soon come upon <hi>New-England,</hi> will the Lord be a Pillar of fire round about <hi>N. Engl.</hi> how pleasing would this be not only to Grace but to Nature, <hi>for the sake of your Wives and your Children, and the Cities of our God?</hi> but the Answer to this question depends upon an answer to another question, <hi>whether the Lord be the Glory in the midst of his Churches in New-England?</hi> I cannot say much to the Answer of so hard a question, neither is it expedient for me upon this occasion to say all I can; but I crave liberty to present to your considerations two Rules of Tryal.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The first, and that which is most manifest is, <hi>when the Lords glory in the midst of a people is a rising glory like the rising sun powerfully convincing the beholders,</hi> like a rising sun looketh forth as the Morning, so heart gladding to the faithful in <hi>Israel</hi> while they behold the Lord arising gloriously into his resting place, adorning Sanctuary means with his Salvation, &amp; maketh his Saints shout for joy, this argueth clearly <hi>

            <p n="2">2. When there is somewhat of a divine Glory yet breaking through the Clouds of all those things which are against a people, that though it be a cloudy day, and yet a day the light doth prevail, that though a time of Eclipse and yet not to total but the light may be seen: now I beseech you suffer me to exemplifie in some plain instances; if Christ hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing against a Church or Christian Common wealth, because they have left their first love and do not their first works, and they are in danger of the removal of their Candlestick if they do not speedily repent, and yet if there be a shine in the midst of these clowdy declinings of that which Christ owneth and calleth labour, work and patience, and cannot bear with them who are evil (who are manifestly and convictingly evil) <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 2, 3. if there be yet any of the splendor of Grace and Godliness breaking through those clowdy declinings, this at present bails them, and the Lord at present preserves them, and continueth waiting and striving with them that they would return and do their first works: but this is only general, let me speak yet a little more particularly, whatever the inormities and scandals of some may be, yet if there be a considerable number of those who shine, but especially if the ruling and carrying party do shine in Grace and Godliness this will argue for that People; if there be yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them a very considerable number of those who have the Seal of God on their Forehead, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 4. and have the qualifications of the Lambs company spoken of in <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 1. <hi>standing upon mount Zion with and for the Lamb of God,</hi> if yet a considerable number of those who sigh because of the abominations committed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. 6, <hi>and weep surely because of th<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47460:9"/> scandalous practises, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 10. so if there be a divine Glory appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Church Assemblies, and Court Assemblies, and maketh the head of the Malefactor to bow down with shame, and others to hear and fear but in no wise to sadden the hearts of the Righteous, whom the Lord will not have made sad.</p>
            <p>Honoured and Beloved in our Lord, the Question now by way of tryal is not whether a Church or Christian Common-wealth be like <hi>Rebekah</hi> of old who felt two Nations, and two manner of People striving in her wombe, a <hi>Jacob</hi> and an <hi>Esau,</hi> this is beyond question, for it hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes thus more or less in any Christian Common-wealth; but the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion now with us is, which of these do prevail? whether Jacob prevailes in the Church, and prevaileth in the Court and Common-wealth, then we may conclude they are blessed, and shall be blessed, and shall in many times and cases see the face and faithfulness of the God of <hi>Israel</hi> while they behold the face of an <hi>Esau.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Ʋse</hi> 3. In the next place let us proceed to a Use of Exhortation; we see upon what condition we have and hold the Lords protecting presence, its upon condition we have and hold his glorious presence in the midst of us, his protecting presence round about us is for the sake of his Glory in the midst of us: its in vain for us to think or act as if we would hold Gods protecting presence, if we do not practically hold up a high esteem of his Glory in the midst of us.</p>
            <p>I beseech you accept of some means, some Motives;</p>
            <p>The first Rule is, Let us call to minde the first Glory in the first planting of <hi>New-England,</hi> and of the Churches here; let us not speak or think of this to the undervaluing of that Glory which yet remaineth, (that is far from my scope) let us be humbly thankful for that, but as a means to retain what is, and to recover what is lost (if it may be) and when we call to minde that first Glory, shall not our hearts be poured out within us? not only calling to minde how the Lord did make his Name Glorious by lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his People through Sea perils, and Wilderness dangers, <hi>Isai.</hi> 63. 14. But O that Converting Glory which did then appear, <hi>multitudes were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to thee O Zion, thine heart afraid and yet enlarged,</hi> Isai. 60 4, 5. Let me say Multitudes, multitudes were converted to thee, even to thee O <hi>Harford,</hi> to thee O <hi>New-Haven,</hi> aad to thee O <hi>Windsor,</hi> and the same may be said of many Churches of Christ in <hi>New England;</hi> and then your Hearts were afraid, (not with base slavish fear in times of danger,) &amp; were enlarged: O the uniting Glory then manifest from the shine of mercy
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47460:9"/> from the Throne, Grace Ruling ond Ordering both Rulers and People un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Glorious Banner of true Gospel holy Love, <hi>for the Banner over them was Love:</hi> then were Colonies united, and Courts united, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates united, and Ministers united, Churches united, and Plantations united; and that strengthening Exhortation how effectual it was? <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 5, 6. <hi>Be strong O Zerubbabel, be strong O Joshua the son of Iosed<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. Let us in the second place consider, that the gradual withdrawings of the Lords Glory from a professing People are imperceptible things, and are not discerned, unless it be by those who have the eye-salve of the Spirit, and are held under special awakenings: As first the withdrawing of that inward and heavenly, that hearty and most real communion with God, and one with another in the wayes of God, that, which while enjoyed, makes a Christian society a Heaven upon Earth, and worthy to bear the Name of the Heaven spoken of in <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 1. and that which was typified by the Glory which came into the inward Court of the Temple, but when this is withdrawn, there may remain a <hi>shine of Ordinances</hi> while they are administred in external order, and an outward decencie; but this is only a shine in the outward Court of the Temple, and if they be only in form and not in power, that form may be soon defaced by time-serving Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, or there may be a holding of the form and yet a denying of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of godliness, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 7. But such withdrawings none at first do discern, unless they be such who have the <hi>Eye-salve of the Spirit</hi> spoken of in <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 18. and are held under special awakenings upon their Minds, Consciences and Hearts; others <hi>Laodicean</hi> like, see not their misery until at last the shadows of the Evening are stretched upon them, and it increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to the darkness of the midnight, and so to utter Confusion and De<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>struction.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If we will have the Lord to be the Glory in the midst of us, we must practically deny any glorying in any thing else: we must put far from us glorying in our shame, as those <hi>whose b<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47460:10"/> and we must put an end to that glorying which is no better then a being haughty because of a holy mountain, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 11, 12 if the Lord will be our Glory he will make us and keep us a humble People by Blasting our fruits, or threatning us with a Sword, or by some humbling means or other, if the Lamb of God be our Glory we must cast down our Crowns before him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. and esteem it our Glory, and reioycing that he hath made us low, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 10. and that through his Grace we can stoop low to him, and to one another in the fear of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But I beseech you let the Exhortation come down yet more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly: we read of an Exhortation in <hi>Psal.</hi> 24. 6, 7 <hi>lift up your heads ye Gates, and open ye everlasting doors that the King of Glory may come in;</hi> who is the King of Glory? <hi>the Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in Battail,</hi> some think this firstly relateth to the opening of the Temple Gates &amp; Doors, when the Ark was to be brought in, upon which between the <hi>Cherubims</hi> the Lord was said to dwell, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8 2-5. but let me use the same Exhortation to you Right Honourable and Beloved in our Lord Jesus Christ; you who sit in Judgement, open your Doors, your Court Doors <hi>that the King of Glory may come in, and be the Glory in the midst of you;</hi> he is come in already, we bless God for his presence among you: but O that he would come with a greater Splendor of his presence, <hi>he is mighty in Battail,</hi> he will defend himself, and he will defend you while <hi>he is the Glory in the midst of you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a Civil Beauty and Moral Glory in a Court, while speech and silence are well observed and rightly ordered, but the Shine is when Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Righteousness and such like virtues are with such a divine lustre and authority, that it commands the Ears and Hearts of those who are your Auditors to bless, and the Eyes of those who behold that they cannot but give Witness while they see <hi>Righteousness like a Robe, and Judgement like a Diadem,</hi> Job 29. 11-14 that is the Glory in the midst of a Court.</p>
            <p>There is a Civil Policy needful in Civil-Estate affairs, but the shine is in Divine Policy, Wisdome from above; Civil Policy is a good Servant, but Divine Policy must be the Master and Ruler: Civil Policy maketh the Face of a Court to shine with a Humane Beauty, and a Moral Lustre, but its Divine Policy maketh to shine as an Angel of God, as was said of <hi>Solomon,</hi> that is the Glory in the midst of a Court.</p>
            <p>There must be an Acting and Ruling according to Humane Laws, and the Patent Liberties, and Charter Priviledges, but the shine is in Divine Laws, upon Humane Laws, as Humane Laws are reducable to, or subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47460:10"/> to Divine Laws, and in no case whatsoever to be contrary to the same, and when the manner of enquiring into a case, and executing of the Law is with the Splendor of pious wisdome and religious impartiality, this is your wisdome among the Nations, that shall make them say, what people are like to you, <hi>who have God so nigh?</hi> Deut 4 6 7. this is the way to be instrumental to put the Crown of the glory of pardoning favour upon the people, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 1. Run you too and fro, and see if you can find a man who <hi>executeth judgement and seeketh truth, and</hi> I <hi>will pardon it,</hi> this is the way <hi>to fear God and honour the King, and not to muddle with those who are given to change,</hi> Prov. 24 21. the good Lord perform that good word more abundantly to you, <hi>Isai.</hi> 28. 5, 6. that he may be to you <hi>the Crown of glory, the Diadem of beauty, the Spirit of judgement to you who si<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of strength to you who turn the batail to the gate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let the Exhortation now come to the <hi>Temple-gates, O ye Temple-gates, lift up your heads that the King of glory may come in!</hi> we hope the Lord is already come into his Temple, and we think we would not loose what yet remains of his presence in his Temple after all our declinings and divisions, not for all the glory of all the Kingdomes of the world, but O that he would come with a greater Splendor of his mercy and holiness, of his grace and purity, we heard of the glory that it is a Shine of Gods Divine excellency as he is the God of mercy and holiness, of grace and purity.</p>
            <p>But surely Gospel glory is contempered of Gospel peace and Gospel purity, of Gospel priviledges and Gospel power, of Gospel liberty and Gospel discipline, to have and hold a proportionable respect to both these; we say a proportionable respect to these, to be as verily, really, and throughly faithful in the exercise of Gospel discipline for the honour of Gospel holiness, as extensive of Liberty for the honour of Gospel love and mercy, I am perswaded in this we generally agree, but O that we would Shine more in the practise of it, this would be a <hi>Glory in the midst of us.</hi> We must put and keep a clean and clear difference between the clean and the unclean, or otherwise holiness will be offended with us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22. 25. and yet we must not call that unclean which God calleth clean, for Gospel mercy and love will take that unkindly at our hands, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 15. now the Lord direct our feet to stand in a sure place, in the Courts of our God, and if we thus keep his charge and walk in his wayes, we shall have places with those who stand by, nigh unto the Lord, <hi>Zoch.</hi> 3. 7.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Let us use only such means for our defence as is consistent with the

The Lord preserve <hi>New-England,</hi> Courts, and Churches from any such Confedaracy with the one, or toleration of the other, as cannot consist with real fidelity to the Lords glory, nor real duty to our King, <hi>Isai</hi> 8. 21. and you who are our Souldiery and Instruments in the Lords hand to turn the battel, I beseech you Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, upon what condition we have the Lord to be our defence, it's upon condition that he be our glory, behave your selves in all your military affairs and concernments, (not as the prophane Souldiery of the world) but with such a Splendor of religious courage and pious magnanimity, with such sparklings of a Spirit of Faith, Prayer, and Piety, as becometh the guard of <hi>New-England</hi> Churches, that the Angels who wait upon <hi>New-England</hi> Churches, <hi>and the glory of God in the midst of them,</hi> may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to be your guard, and to be with you in the Camp, and if it must come to the tryal, you will soon perceive, that you have more for you then can come against you.</p>
            <p>Let me now adde a few words to you who are the Freemen, respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the work of the day, the Election of your Rulers: the Lord perswade your hearts to put farre from you all sidings and party-taking Interests, and to side only with the Lord and his glory, and therefore to choose such whom you are perswaded in the sight of the Lord, will be instrumental (through the Lords blessing) to hold up the glory amongst you. That it may be said of this Colony, as of <hi>Judah</hi> of old, yet <hi>Judah</hi> ruleth with God, and is faithful with the Saints, <hi>Hos.</hi> 11. <hi>ult.</hi> so that it may be said, yet <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticot Colony</hi> ruleth with God, and is faithful with the Saints.</p>
            <p>In the last place, let us all bow down, and beg earnestly of the Lord for transforming visions of this glory. Multitudes see a glory, and yet they hear and understand not, they see and perceive not, <hi>Isai</hi> 6. 9, 10. <hi>Behold ye Despisers, wonder, and perish,</hi> Act. 13 41. they beheld that which causeth them to wonder, and yet wondring they perish, the Lord grant that we may have a transforming sight as you heard out of the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi> when <hi>Moses</hi> had been upon the Mount conversing with the Lord, his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance

O that Magistrates might more and more shine, and Deputies shine, Ministers shine, and Church-members shine, and Heads of Families shine, and this will be the means to make the Rising Generation shine in Grace and Godliness, or else will at least make them ashamed to appear in a profane posture: but its not Natural nor Moral Abilities, nor common gifts of the Spirit can help us with these transforming Visions, we must down upon our knees at the <hi>Footstool of the Lord,</hi> and beg of him, that if we have found fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in his sight, if <hi>New England</hi> hath found favour, if your <hi>Courts</hi> and <hi>Churches</hi> hath found favour, if we have found favour for our selves and for ours, that the Lord would shew us this Glory, that yet we and ours may be <hi>for a People, for a Name and for a Praise to him.</hi>

            <p>And new I beseech you to accept of some Motives to settle the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:</p>
